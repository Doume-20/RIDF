* Using xcas *

Xcas may be started like any Windows application.
If you want to use firefox as help browser
/c/Program\ Files/Mozilla\ Firefox/firefox.exe

You can modify the localization for your country. The menus
may be modified by copying e.g. el.po to your country initials
(e.g. de.po) and editing the file, then call e.g.
  msgfmt de.po -o locale/LC_MESSAGES/de/giac.mo
Edit the file doit.sh to do this automatically.
Then you must add a subdirectory in the doc directory with files
xcasmenu, xcasex and documentation, like for French or English.
When you are finished please send us the files for inclusion in Xcas.

* Using giac *
**************
giac.exe is a text-based application that require a terminal with I/O
capabilities. Examples of programs providing such terminals :

- The provided rxvt terminal. Run rungiac.bat from a DOS command prompt.
Special thanks to Franz Huber who sent me the rxvt terminal.

- Cygwin rxvt terminal in the X11 windowing system. If required run
  startx
  then open a Terminal and run 
  ./giac

- texmacs
  Be sure to add /cygdrive/c/xcas to the PATH (Unix) or c:\xcas 
to the PATH (DOS). Under cygwin, type
  export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/xcas
then run texmacs
  /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/WinTeXmacs/TeXmacs/bin/tmwin.exe
and use Insert->Session->Giac
  (plotting does not work currently)

- emacs
  Run emacs, then run a shell inside emacs: Esc-x shell then ./giac
I don't know if mupacs works under emacs!

The Cygwin terminal outside X11 will not work, the DOS command prompt
will not work. If you don't have a working terminal and still want
to use giac (e.g. from command prompt), you can enter your input in a 
text file with a text editor, named say test, and run (from c:\xcas)
  giac < test > test2
you will get your answers inside the text file test2.

Running giac inside texmacs:


*************************************************************
* Linking an application with the giac library under cygwin *
*************************************************************
You can build C++ applications using the giac library with the 
cygwin development tools. Assuming xcas is in the standard path (c:\xcas)
and you have a link from /c to /cygdrive/c (hence xcas is in /c/xcas 
for cygwin),

To compile an application using giac, e.g. pgcd.cc, type
g++ -I/c/xcas/include -g pgcd.cc giac.dll -DWIN32 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DIN_GIAC -DDOUBLEVAL -DUSE_OPENGL32 -DGIAC_GENERIC_CONSTANTS -lpthread -lintl -mwindows -lole32 -luuid -lcomctl32 -lwsock32
Warning: Terminal I/O generally do not work on windows, run interactive programs with < for input and > for output or from inside an environment that support I/O like inside emacs

For some help on giac API, look at doc/en/giac_us.html, then at the source
in /c/xcas/include and /c/xcas/src

****************************************
* Compile and install giac from source *
****************************************
1/ If you don't have the NTL, GMP, GSL, etc. libraries, install them.
http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac_compile.html
To install giac, try
 export CXXFLAGS="-L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/lib -I/usr/local/include"
 ./configure
 make
 make -f Makefile.win giac.dll
 make -f Makefile.win icasdll
 make -f Makefile.win xcasdll
For development, copy giac.dll to /bin and /usr/local/lib, 
and copy .h files to /usr/local/include/giac
For more details, see http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/dll.html#DLL-BUILD

2/ Copy giac headers from the include directory, or from source
using make install or by hand
  mkdir /usr/local/include/giac
  cp src/*.h /usr/local/include/giac
  cp config.h /usr/local/include/giac
